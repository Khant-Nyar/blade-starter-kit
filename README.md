# Laravel Blade Starter Kit

A Blade port of the official Laravel Starter Kit.

This starter kit features many of the conveniences you'd expect in a modern framework. It has beautiful UI components built with [Alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com), route pre-fetching provided by [instant.page](https://instant.page), and Livewire-like reactivity powered by [Alpine AJAX](https://alpine-ajax.js.org).

## Installation

Create a new Laravel application using this starter kit through the official [Laravel Installer](https://laravel.com/docs/12.x/installation#installing-php):

```bash
laravel new my-app --using=imacrayon/blade-starter-kit
```

## Want More Components?

Get even more high-quality components by purchasing the official [Alpine UI Components](https://alpinejs.dev/components).

## Icons

This starter kit uses the refined and versatile [Phosphor](https://phosphoricons.com/) icon collection. However, you can easily replace this collection with any icon set supported by [Blade UI Kit Icons](https://blade-ui-kit.com/blade-icons). To add a new icon set, `composer require` the icon package and replace any `phosphor-*` references with a reference to your preferred icon. You can even install multiple icon collections in the same project, go nuts.

## Coming Soon

Bolt: An API that supports file-based routing for Blade templates.
